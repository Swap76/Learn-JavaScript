# Browser Object Model

## What we can do using BOM Model
-The Browser Object Model (BOM) is used to interact with the browser.
-The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.
-it can be used to manipulate methods and properties associated with the Web browser itself.

## Why to use it
-BOM provides you with window object, for example, to show the width and height of the window. It also includes the window.screen object to show the width and height of the screen.

## How we can optimize our sites after taking inputs
-Order in which elements are loaded
-Minify JavaScript code for smaller file sizes.
-Optimize it!
-Asynchronous loading of JavaScript: Defer and Async tags
-Exclude unused components of .JS libraries.
