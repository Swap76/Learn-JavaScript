# Objects
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

-Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)

-Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)

-Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)

-Dates are always objects

-Maths are always objects

-Regular expressions are always objects

-Arrays are always objects

-Functions are always objects

-Objects are always objects

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

Example:
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
